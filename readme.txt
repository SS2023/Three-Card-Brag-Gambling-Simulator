Programs:

    Run the martingale.py for the martingale strategy results.
    Run the anit-martingale.py for the anti-martingale strategy results.
    After running the program, martingale.png and anti-martingale.png will plot the simulations.

        Enter a positive betting amount.
        Enter a positive number of players.
        Enter the amount of money each of the players has. Must be greater than the betting amount.
