Check List ----- Done
While compared to homework 4, 2.0 effort went into completing this project. In this
project, first I had to implement the game and its rules. Then, I had to build a simulation for the
game. Figuring out how to implement the Martingale and anti-martingale into the game was
tricky. I was able to implement the strategies by ending the game when one player runs out of
money.
